# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this new analysis is to figure out the gradual differences between different city types (Urban, Suburban and Rural) visually over the change of total fare prices (as well as other characteristics) across the first half of 2019, and conclude with confidence on possible changes that may improve on PyBer's business model in order to make them a greatly successful corporation.

## Results

At a first [glance](analysis/PyBer_summary_table.png) we see that **urban** cities have a greater number of rides and drivers at lower fares in comparison to both **suburban** and specially **rural** cities; with *1,625* rides for urban cities, and *625* and *125* rides for suburban and rural cities respectively. Drivers for **urban** cities are *2,405* while **suburban** cities have *490* and **rural** cities have *78*.

It is also of note that urban users pay on average *less* per ride (**$24.53**) and driver (**$16.57**) than suburban (**$30.97** and **$39.50**) and rural (**$34.62** and **$55.49**) users. This may be due to the greater availability and competition of drivers in urban centers, though further analysis would be needed to support this theory.

Over time, the [total fares](analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) remained on the same position throughout the period between January and May of 2019, with **urban** total fares being higher than **suburban** and **rural** fares. They all have small peaks starting around late February to early March, but otherwise remain relatively constant.

The fact that, overall, total fares add up to a greater amount for urban users (**$39,854.38**) than for rural and suburban users combined (**$23,684.26**) points to the fact that the main factor in profitability is number of rides and drivers available more than the actual individual fare price.  

## Summary

Our analysis demonstrated that we need a greater focus on our reach on Suburban and Rural cities and towns where we have drivers and provide our services. As a ride-sharing company, there is a limited range of variables that we may adjust in order to increase the success of our business. The two most important of such parameters are: visibility, fare prices and routes. Taking such into consideration, I recommend the following options:

- We may wish to invest in an awareness campaign for our service, targeted at Rural and Suburban centers, in order to proportionally increase the number of drivers we have to meet the demand present in these areas. This option may be costly in the short term, but may yield long term results for our business. It may also naturally reduce prices in these cities, as an increase in drivers will make fares much more competitive.

- If we want to make the service more accessible to the public, we can reduce the fare price for the Rural and Suburban cities, and raise the fares of Urban cities, such that they remain relatively the same, at equilibrium. This may cause a reduction of clients available in urban cities, however, this effect may be offset by the increase of users in both Suburban and Rural Cities.

- Another solution would be to institute a coordinated system for drivers, such that drivers do not need to compete against each other on rural and suburban areas, where destinations are more spread out, drivers may want to 'localize' within a city and work in sectors such that they won't have to travel too far and are able to pick up passengers more easily on commonly-travelled routes. This will help increase the number of rides that each driver is able to give.

In a rapidly growing industry, none of these recommendations will guarantee the profitability of our business and carry with them their own risks and consequences. However, I believe this analysis and its conclusions are a big stepping stone into the long term success for all of us.
